## V1 Prompts

- Prompt 1:
```txt
A logo of a menacing great white shark in the American Traditional_Retro_Tattoo Art style. The shark has soulless black eyes and a greedy sneer, biting viciously into a classic German railroad station clock. The clock, featuring the Deutsche Bahn (DB) logo at the top, is cracked and shows the time eleven forty-three. The design has bold black outlines, vibrant, saturated colors, and is presented as a 'die-cut' sticker with a thick white border. Perfect for a GitHub profile picture, high detail, simple background.
```
- Prompt 2:
```txt
A black and white, hand-drawn sketch logo of an evil and greedy great white shark viciously biting into a classic German railroad station clock. The shark's eyes are solid, soulless black voids. The highly detailed clock face clearly shows the time eleven forty-three and features the 'DB' (Deutsche Bahn) logo at the top. The art style is that of a detailed graphite pencil or ink sketch, with intricate linework and cross-hatching for shading. The composition is centered and circular, perfect for a GitHub profile picture, set against a simple, clean white background.
```
- Prompt 3:
```txt
A highly detailed logo in the style of a Carnival Freakshow_Retro poster. The poster, on an aged and weathered paper background, sensationally presents a monstrous, evil great white shark with pitch-black eyes and a greedy expression. The shark is billed as "The Beast that Ate the Timetable!", shown biting into a German railroad station clock. The clock face, with the DB logo at the top, is shattered and shows 11:43. The design uses garish, faded colors, bold, vintage typography, and a hand-painted aesthetic. Circular composition perfect for a GitHub profile picture.
```
- Prompt 4:
```txt
A modern Concert Poster Design for a GitHub profile picture. A highly stylized, graphic logo of an evil great white shark. The shark, composed of clean vector shapes and sharp angles, has menacing solid-black eyes and is biting into a minimalist German railroad station clock. The clock dial shows eleven forty-three and features the DB logo. The design uses a limited, high-contrast 3-color palette (e.g., charcoal gray, signal red, and cream) with a subtle screen-print texture overlay. Simple background, high detail, very graphic and bold.
